- Use a checkbox do remove old entries.
-- Where should it appear?
-- Show the checkbox on the entries inside the accordion
-- It's possible to remove multiple entries

- Remove the CSS styling from the theme's repo and put it here.
-- Also change everything to classes.
-- And treat it as a big list!
