TO DO LIST
==========

- Better method naming in the IndigoPlateau class
- Leave the IndigoPlateau class in its own file
- Refactor the admin panel's code; it's a mess (but hey, we're using PHP here, how COULDN'T it be a mess?!)
- Refactor the table printing methods, they're a mess... shorter, more focused methods blablabla I wish this was Ruby, damnit

- create_table
-
