TO DO LIST
==========

- Leave the IndigoPlateau class in its own file (fuck PHP)

- Refactor the admin panel's code: urrghhhhhhhh

- On entries creation
-- Group entries as a JSON before sending them to the server
-- So it's possible to add multiple entries at once

- Use a checkbox do remove old entries. Where should it appear?
-- Show the checkbox on the entries inside the accordion
-- So it's possible to remove multiple entries

- Remove the CSS styling from the theme's repo and put it here.
-- Also change everything to classes.
-- And treat it as a big list!
